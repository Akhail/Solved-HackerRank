## Marc's Cakewalk
Marc loves cupcakes, but he also likes to stay fit. He eats cupcakes in one sitting, and each cupcake has a calorie count, . After eating a cupcake with calories, he must walk at least 2^j * c (where is the number cupcakes he has already eaten) miles to maintain his weight.

Given the individual calorie counts for each of the cupcakes, find and print a long integer denoting the minimum number of miles Marc must walk to maintain his weight. Note that he can eat the cupcakes in any order.

## Sparse Arrays
There are N strings. Each string's length is no more than 20 characters.
There are also Q queries. For each query, you are given a string, and you need to find out how many times this string occurred previously.

## Left Rotation
A left rotation operation on an array of size n shifts each of the array's
elements 1 unit to the left. For example, if 2 left rotations are performed on
array [1,2,3,4,5], then the array would become [3,4,5,1,2].

Given an array of n integers and a number, d, perform d left rotations
on the array. Then print the updated array as a single line of space-separated integers.
